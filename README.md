This is the smallest Grpc example I could make.
Everything was taken from the https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java project but only the stuff needed for the HelloWorld is in this repo.

To build and run do:
1. clone the project in the eclipse workspace
2. create a java project
3. configure the project to be a maven project
4. Project >> Update Maven project.
5. Run as a java application OneRoundTrip.java
